# Book Search Engine


## Description

- My motivation for this project was to create a functional book search engine that allows users to log in and out, save books, and create new accounts.
- I built this project to further understand how to GraphQL, APIs, and MongoDB.
- This code is effective in allowing users to search for books that fall into their interests.
- Composing this backend project, I learned how to better understand React and Mongo DB in a way that creates a functioning webpage.
